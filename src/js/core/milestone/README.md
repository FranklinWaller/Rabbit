# Milestones for Rutile

Milestones (and Merge) transactions are used for having finalaty for smart contracts. It uses the regular DAG as a proposal mechanism to find transactions that are sending information to a perticular smart contract. You can see the DAG as a message protocol in this way and the milestone part as an actor.

## Milestones

Milestones can be compared to a main chain. It references multiple transactions including the previous milestone. It includes multiple roots of the currents state of the network. Milestones are final and cannot be reversed.

## Merge transactions

Merge transactions are created by active participants of the network and allow smart contract interactions to be modifying the state.
