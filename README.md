# Rutile
Rutile is a decentralized platform for executing scripts, storing files keeping a global state.
Rutile is not based on blockchain but rather on a Directed Acyclic Graph (For example The Tangle in IOTA). This allows for fee less transactions, better scalibility and faster confirmations.

Rutile is currently in development but is actively worked on.
